# Hi, I'm Litesh — AI Engineer / AI Developer

I design and ship end-to-end AI systems that drive real impact: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), multi-agent workflows, and production ML services.

- Recent: Led an LLM/agent initiative using MCP to orchestrate tools/data on GCP; built crypto portfolio forecasting pipeline with feature store + backtesting.
- Built Smart Tutor AI (LlamaIndex + Chroma + Ollama) with metadata-aware chunking, evals, and guardrails.
- Delivered fraud detection on 1M+ transactions (92% accuracy) and a CNN for skin cancer detection (85% on 10k+ images).

## Tech I use
Python, FastAPI, LangChain, LlamaIndex, Hugging Face, TensorFlow, PyTorch, vector DBs (Chroma, FAISS, pgvector, Oracle AI Vector Search), GCP (Vertex AI, Cloud Run), Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, SQL/NoSQL.

## Selected repositories
- Smart-Tutor-AI — RAG system with LlamaIndex/Chroma/Ollama, evals + guardrails.
- FraudCatcher.ML — Streamlit app for real-time fraud detection.
- Powering-AI-Infrastructure-at-Scale — infra and patterns for deploying LLM/agentic systems on GCP.

## What I'm looking for
AI Engineer / AI Developer / ML Engineer roles (remote or Dallas–Fort Worth). Open to internships and full-time.
