Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a passionate Data Science Master's student at the University of North Texas, with a strong foundation in Computer Science from India. My journey into data has led me through exciting projects, from developing machine learning models to creating data pipleines and visualising data . Iâ€™m on a mission to turn raw data into meaningful insights!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as an Academic Assistant at Discovery Park Library Services, where I support data needs and research inquiries.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced data engineering techniques and exploring NLP (Natural Language Processing).
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data science and machine learning projects, especially those with real-world impact.
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Python, SQL, R, and Machine Learning conceptsâ€”Iâ€™m always ready to share knowledge and learn from others.

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a huge fan of patternsâ€”not just in data, but in everyday life too! Whether it's spotting trends in code or figuring out the best strategies in games, I'm always on the lookout for that hidden logic.
